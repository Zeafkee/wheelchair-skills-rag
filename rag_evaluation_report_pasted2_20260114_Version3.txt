RAG vs No-RAG — Rubric Evaluation Report 
Generated: 2026-01-14
Source: pasted2.txt (RAG vs NO-RAG COMPARISON TEST REPORT)
Test date in source: 2026-01-14
Total skills evaluated: 14

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Purpose & context
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This report re-evaluates the pasted2.txt test results using the project's weighted rubric:
- Sub-scores: Correctness 40%, Completeness 20%, Sequence/Ordering 10%, Safety/Specificity 10%, Directionality 10%, Format/Parsability 10%.
- Final percent → 1–10 mapping: >=95%→10, 85–94→9, 75–84→8, 65–74→7, 55–64→6, 45–54→5, 35–44→4, 25–34→3, 15–24→2, <15→1.

Assumptions (scoring applied):
- Correctness = fraction of expected canonical actions found (after synonym normalization).
- Completeness roughly mirrors correctness unless missing/extra actions were explicitly noted.
- Sequence given full credit unless output showed clear ordering errors.
- Safety = proportion of expected safety actions (brake, pop_casters, spotter) present.
- Directionality credit lowered when only one direction present where two are expected.
- Format = 100% if the run parsed or had Found: lists; 0% if explicit JSON parse error noted.
- Final percent computed as weighted sum of subscores, then mapped to integer 1–10.

2) Per-model summary (rubric-based re-evaluation)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Each model's total is the sum of fourteen 1–10 skill scores. Averages are per-skill 1–10.)

- RAG + GPT-5-mini
  - Total (14 skills): 127 / 140
  - Average (1–10): 9.07 ≈ 9.1 / 10

- RAG + Gemini-3-Flash
  - Total (14 skills): 126 / 140
  - Average (1–10): 9.00 = 9.0 / 10

- No-RAG GPT-5-mini
  - Total (14 skills): 123 / 140
  - Average (1–10): 8.79 ≈ 8.8 / 10

- No-RAG Gemini-3-Flash
  - Total (14 skills): 119 / 140
  - Average (1–10): 8.50 = 8.5 / 10

Interpretation:
- After the recent ingestion/updates (test outputs in pasted2.txt), both RAG configurations now outperform the No‑RAG runs on this 14-skill set when evaluated with the weighted rubric.
- RAG + GPT-5-mini is the top performer by a small margin. Improvements are concentrated on previously under-retrieved, maneuver-focused skills.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Per-skill notable outcomes (high level)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Below are concise highlights for skills where the new results show material change or continued issues. Scores stated qualitatively (approx 1–10 effect).

- Skill #1 — Rolls forwards 10 m
  - All models: perfect canonical coverage.
  - Score: 10/10 across the board.

- Skill #4 — Turn 90° while moving backwards
  - RAG + GPT-5-mini: now includes both turn_left & turn_right → full credit (10/10).
  - RAG + Gemini: mostly correct but one run missed turn_right → ~8/10.
  - No‑RAGs: each chose one direction; acceptable but direction-locked → ~8/10.

- Skill #5 — Turn in place 180°
  - RAG runs returned both directions and supporting steps → high scores (10/10).
  - No‑RAG GPT-5-mini: one-direction bias (turn_left-only logs) → lower score (~6/10).
  - No‑RAG Gemini: had a JSON parse error in one run — heavily penalized for format.

- Skill #6 — Maneuver sideways 0.5 m
  - RAG + GPT-5-mini: correct zigzag micro-steps (back → pivot → forward) → 10/10.
  - RAG + Gemini: mostly correct but sometimes omitted the initial back step → ~9/10.
  - No‑RAGs: mixed outputs; some lacked the back/pivot micro-step → 5–8/10.

- Skill #7 — Gets through hinged door
  - Mixed results across models. RAG-Gemini included turns but sometimes omitted an explicit brake or back-up step; other runs included pop_casters but not full sequencing.
  - Scores: mixed 4–6/10 range depending on run; overall remains a moderate weakness.

- Skill #17 — Ascend 10° incline
  - All models: solid performance with safety detail → 10/10.

- Skill #19 — Roll across 5° side-slope
  - RAG‑Gemini: fully captured steering correction → 10/10.
  - RAG‑GPT: some runs still omitted explicit turn action → lower (≈5/10) in run(s).
  - No‑RAGs: generally correct but sometimes direction-limited → ~7/10.

- Skills #21, #22, #25 — gap/threshold/curb handling
  - All models: canonical pop_casters + forward + brake present → 10/10.

- Skill #27 — Stationary wheelie 30s
  - All models: included pop_casters and brake → 10/10.

- Skill #28 — Wheelie 180 turn
  - RAG + GPT-5-mini: returned pop_casters and both turn actions in one run → high score.
  - RAG + Gemini and No-RAGs: mixed; some runs missed turn_left or turn_right → 6–8/10.

- Skill #29 — Ascend incline in wheelie
  - Mostly correct across models; occasional missing 'brake' in a RAG-Gemini run reduced score slightly.

- Skill #30 — Ascend curb in wheelie
  - Most runs correct; isolated RAG-GPT run missed an explicit brake → slight penalty.

Overall pattern:
- The added/rewritten retrieval documents and canonical phrasing materially improved RAG outputs on maneuver and direction-sensitive skills (sideways, backward-turns, wheelie pivots).
- Remaining errors concentrate on multi-step, context-sensitive tasks (door negotiation) and isolated missing safety tokens (missing 'brake' in a small number of runs).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Root causes & observations (from rubric perspective)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Retrieval coverage: RAG now returns the expected canonical labels for several skills.
- Directionality: models still sometimes choose a single direction instead of listing alternatives (reduces Directionality sub-score).
- Safety omissions: a small number of runs omitted explicit safety tokens (brake/pop_casters). Because Safety sub-score is part of the weighted rubric, this has a noticeable effect.
- Format errors: isolated JSON parse failure in earlier tests penalizes Format/Parsability heavily. Ensure parser robustness or require JSON canonical arrays.
