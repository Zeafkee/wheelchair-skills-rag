RAG + GPT-5-mini: 7/10 Rationale: Provided both hands/opposite strokes, pop casters etc., but missed a canonical direction in some logs — good technical detail.

RAG + Gemini-3-Flash: 10/10 Rationale: Returned both turn_left and turn_right and the correct sequence — very complete.

No‑RAG GPT-5-mini: 5/10 Rationale: Returned repeated single-direction turns (turn_right only) — incomplete.

No‑RAG Gemini-3-Flash: 4/10 Rationale: Output failed/parsed poorly or returned single-direction only in the log — incomplete.

=============================================================================== SKILL #6 — Maneuver sideways 0.5m Question: How to move sideways 0.5m (zigzag/pivot pattern) Expected: move_forward, move_backward, turn_left, turn_right (zigzag)

RAG + GPT-5-mini: 3/10 Rationale: Returned only forward/brake pattern, missing pivot/turn — incorrect.

RAG + Gemini-3-Flash: 3/10 Rationale: Same deficiency — missing turn actions.

RAG + GPT-5-mini: 4/10 Rationale: Basic forward/brake approach but omits turning/clearance actions; partial.

RAG + Gemini-3-Flash: 4/10 Rationale: Similar partial approach (some pop_casters), missing full door-handling moves.

No‑RAG GPT-5-mini: 4/10 Rationale: Mixed (pop_casters used inconsistently); did not capture full maneuver complexity.

No‑RAG Gemini-3-Flash: 4/10 Rationale: Simple forward/brake steps only; incomplete.

=============================================================================== SKILL #17 — Ascend 10° incline Question: How to ascend a 10° incline? Expected: move_forward, brake (and safety details)

RAG + Gemini-3-Flash: 3/10 Rationale: Similar omission — likely retrieval of incline docs rather than slope handling.

No‑RAG GPT-5-mini: 7/10 Rationale: Included uphill turn compensation and forward pushes — correct concept.

No‑RAG Gemini-3-Flash: 7/10 Rationale: Same correct approach.

=============================================================================== SKILL #21 — Get over gap 15cm Question: How to get over a 15 cm gap? Expected: move_forward, pop_casters

RAG + Gemini-3-Flash — 7.6/10 (107/140)
Interpretation: No‑RAG runs (especially Gemini) performed best overall on this skill set. RAG produced useful domain-accurate outputs for some complex, domain-specific skills (e.g., pivot technique, some wheelie details) but underperformed or retrieved irrelevant context for certain maneuver-focused skills (sideways, side-slope, door negotiation), causing omissions and occasional truncation.

=============================================================================== KEY OBSERVATIONS & ROOT CAUSES

Strengths (where all models excelled): straightforward mobility actions (forward rolling, gap/threshold/curb handling, wheelie ascents) — these are canonical and well represented in model knowledge.
Weaknesses (where models diverged): stepwise/directional tasks and maneuvers requiring action-choice (turn-left vs turn-right), sideways zigzag technique, door negotiation. RAG runs sometimes retrieved documents that lacked these specific techniques or were too verbose, producing irrelevant steps.
Operational issues: truncation / finish_reason='length' appears in some runs; an evaluation JSON parse error occurred for at least one output — make parsing robust and add continuation logic.
