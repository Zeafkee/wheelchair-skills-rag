{"id":"faq-004","type":"faq","title":"What are common errors when turning on the spot?","source":"author","content":"Over-gripping, letting hands leave the rims, and not counter-moving hands (one forward, one back). For tight turns, hold the inside wheel still and push the outside.","structured":{"prerequisites":["Turning on the spot"],"evaluation":{"success_criteria":["Tight pivot without drift"],"metrics":["turn_radius","drift_distance"]}}}
{"id":"faq-005","type":"faq","title":"Which stroke patterns should I use for long distances?","source":"author","content":"Semi-circle or DLOP are best for steady or longer distances. Semi-circle provides periodic rest; DLOP uses a wrist flick and full release for speed and efficiency.","structured":{"prerequisites":["Basic propulsion"],"evaluation":{"success_criteria":["Even cadence","Low overuse risk"],"metrics":["cadence_variation","peak_force"]}}}
{"id":"faq-006","type":"faq","title":"How do drag turns differ from push-off turns?","source":"author","content":"Drag turns: brush the wall behind your rear wheel, initiating turn after the axle clears the corner.

{"id":"faq-009","type":"faq","title":"What’s the correct hand position when propelling?","source":"author","content":"Treat the wheel like a clock: hands engage between ~11 and 2 o'clock during push.
